            <h2>Who built the Colosseum?</h2>
            <p>The Colosseum was started under Emperor Vespasian, but he died before it was completed. Construction was finished under his two sons, Emperors Titus and Domitian. The actual building was done largely by Jewish slaves, overseen by Roman engineers and craftsmen.</p>

            <h2>How many people participated in its construction?</h2>
            <p>After gaining victory in the first Jewish-Roman war, the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem was sacked and many of the province’s inhabitants were made slaves. They were transported back to Rome and it is estimated that 60,000 to 100,000 were employed in the construction of the Colosseum.</p>

            <h2>Why was the Colosseum built?</h2>
            <p>After the great fire of 64 AD, in which a substantial portion of the city burned, Emperor Nero ordered the construction of a magnificent palace for himself in the area that had been devastated. The palace was the Domus Aurea (which today is being excavated and can be visited). Needless to say, the citizens of Rome were not happy about this, so when Nero was deposed and Emperor Vespasian ascended to the throne, he had Nero’s palace complex torn down and ordered that the Colosseum be built on top what had been an artificial lake. The Colosseum was to become a grand amphitheater where all Roman citizens could seek entertainment.</p>

            <h2>What does the Colosseum’s name mean?</h2>
            <p>The Colosseum was originally known as the Flavian Amphitheater, because it was built by Emperors Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, successors to Nero of the Flavian dynasty. The name “Colosseum” likely comes from the colossal bronze statue of Emperor Nero that used to stand next to the building. This statue was itself modeled on the Colossus of Rhodes.</p>
